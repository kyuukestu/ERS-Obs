## Steenee

While doing her rounds as a League Trainer against Motostoke Gym, Esther leaves Ciera on the side-line as the grass-type is not the best choice against the fire gym. Ciera is spotted by Wingull who recognize her and mock her for being left out of the battle, suggesting that all her growth hasn't amounted to much. 

In a fury she thrashes them but they call back-up from a Pelipper who gobbles her up and takes her out to Rolling Fields. Their Drizzle casts the rain which reduces the amount of health Synthesis can restore and when Esther final arrives on scene to assist, Halay halts here while challenging Ciera. 'Was all your training for naught? Will you remain the same fearful child you were months ago?' which then triggers the evolution.
