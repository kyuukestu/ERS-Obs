If the essence of a burned-out fire could be pressed into human form, it might look a lot like Esther: a veil of ashen goth wrapped around a smoldering core.

Once a wildfire of a child—untamed and possessed of a fierce, self-destructive energy—she has since learned to take that heat and transform it into brilliance. The Esther of today is a charming young lady whose steady warmth betrays a tendency for flare-ups and dramatics.

Esther thrives in motion beneath adoring gazes. She dreams big, strides bigger, and pursues her goals with a joy that borders on hunger. For Esther, nothing beats the thrill—the thrill of battle, the thrill of performance, the thrill of a audience who’s excitement threatens to consume her—these are the moments she lives for, the moments that ignite her blood like nothing else.

At her core, Esther craves adoration—from friends, from family, from community—and views personal excellence as the surest path to it. To inspire, to entertain, to leave an audience brighter than she found them—these are her measures of worth. She does not beg for attention; rather, she believes recognition should be the natural consequence of her worth. Those who fail to see it, she deems unworthy of her energy.  

Beneath the poise and pride lies a girl who fears rejection, one who believes love must be earned and whose stubborn insecurities push her to ever-grander ambitions.
