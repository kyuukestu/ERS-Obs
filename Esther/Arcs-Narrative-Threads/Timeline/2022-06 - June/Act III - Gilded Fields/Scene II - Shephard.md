## 2022-06-12
Promoted to Shepard since she handles pokémon well. Lead younger Wooloo & Skiddo to graze within ranch enclosures. Esther also learns basic poké first-aid to treat injured farm animals. Accompanied by ranch Yamper. Esther notices the parent pokémon, Gogoat & Dubwool watch as she tends to their children. Her pokédex notes that Gogoat is empathic, and Esther tries to hone her abilities by learning from Gogoat.

Herding Pokémon:
- Take Wooloo, Skiddo, Miltank & co. to pasture.
- Skiddo & Gogoat are taken out last as they help the grass regrow faster for the next day.

Sometimes troublesome, but mostly harmless pokémon can slip through the fences:
- Oddish – They move during the night and bury themselves during the day; might wander into feeding area & ‘poison powder’ Wooloo who mistake them regular grass.
- Butterfree – Scatter poisonous scales, not as bad as Venomoth but more dangerous for the younger pokémon.
- Budew & Roselia – Generally toxic, Roselia more threatening but don’t usually provoke. Will fiercely defend their fiercely defend their young.
- Zigzagoon ­– Pick fights, eat berries, mostly harmless.  
    A Zigzagoon picks a fight with Pyrrha and Esther lets them ‘play’ while she works. At the end she gives them both Oran berries to restore their strength. This Zigzagoon makes repeat appearances.

_**Evening**_

The ranch provides starter pokémon to kids whose parents can’t afford to go out and catch one. Ranch-trainers are often discriminated against or bullied. Esther intervenes and drives them off with a pokémon battle. Gogoat & Houndour take notice.

- vs Kids

## 2022-06-13

Shepard duties.

The kids from earlier are back and they’ve brought back-up. Older brother? Noted to be ‘like’ Team Yell? Super-fans/Hooligans who’re generally disruptive and rude. They see ranch trainers are ‘bringing down’ the quality of Motostoke trainers. Esther & Pyrrha do battle (vs. Thievul), they begin on the back foot. Pyrrha rampages when they’re provoked (Esther insulted, Pyrrha hit with torment?), Esther is hurt trying to stop her from doing too much to the bully’s pokémon. Pyrrha closes herself off after hurting Esther.

#poke-pov: Pyrrha 
- Her reaction to losing control.
- Fear, apprehension – Will Esther abandon her?
- Allusion to backstory.
    
#poke-pov: Houndour 
- Her thoughts on Esther; thoughts on the situation at hand (she also takes care of her 'pack'); assessment of Pyrrha
- The hints of a changing opinion; Houndour still doesn’t like Esther. ‘It’s none of her business.’
- She notices Gogoat watching.
    
Back at the ranch Esther meets an older trainer who wows her with telepathy. She’s been having trouble communicating with Houndour and Pyrrha, so Esther seeks out a pokémon with Telepathy. She learns about Munna, who are nocturnal.


### Night
Esther sets out to catch a Munna with telepathy. On her first encounter Pyrrha refused to come out of her pokéball, and the first Munna flees.

On her second encounter she opts to simply toss a pokéball. Houndour interferes and shatters the pokéball. Though initially upset, Esther notices that Houndour’s hostility is renewed she stands protectively before the Munn. Ester pieces together that Houndour doesn’t like when pokémon are forcefully captured.

Makes a deal with Houndour: if a pokémon willingly joins Esther’s team, she (Houndour) can’t interfere. It can even watch to make sure.

Unable to battle and unable to toss pokéballs Esther wracks her brain over how to obtain a Munna.

Encounters the Camping King—he’s recently returned from Paldea and has refined his curry techniques with what he learned there; he teaches Esther how to make curry with encounter power and she begins to attract many Munna.

She allows them to eat and convinces a sleepy-looking Munna to join her team. She names it Pariparisithea.

With Munna’s aid, Esther has a heart-to-heat with Pyrrha.
- Pyrrha backstory, via Munna dream mist
    - Her anger; it’s consequences; past trainers.
    - Esther forms an empathic bond to re-assure Pyrrha.  
    - Houndour also warms to/acknowledges Esther; agrees to help around the ranch.

#poke-pov : Pyrrha
- Fear of abandonment  $\to$ elation & affection
- Had been mocked being returned to the shelter?
	- Complex around her strength; she's supposed to be strong, Trainers want her for the explicit purpose of being strong, her anger erupts when her strength is questioned
- Bond from Pyrrha’s POV
    

Zigzagoon re-appears.

#poke-pov: Zigzagoon
- ‘Playing’ with Pyrrha
- It notes she’s in a very good mood.    
- Pyrrha refers to Esther as ‘Mom’.
    
_**Afternoon**_

Esther has three pokémon now. The Ranch owner takes notice, having also learned about her recent wins, and begins to assign Esther to more difficult patrols. The more adult animals range a bit further from the ranch to graze. Aided by Boltund. These areas border the wild area proper and dangerous pokémon from the Dappled Grove & Rolling Fields can appear:
- Diggersby – May damage the field with holes.
- Crustle – Highly territorial, occasionally encroaches on the ranch territory.
- Piloswine – Wanders in looking for food, digs up plants, damages fencing, etc.
- Vileplume – May spread toxic spores that make the ranch Pokémon sick.
- Pangoro – May go on violent rampages and cross the ranch’s territory.
- Manectric – Targets the ranch animals; they are pack animals. Considered the most dangerous of the ‘regular’ threats. Requires back-up from Boltund.
- **Mamoswine** – Rare but incredibly dangerous when they show up.

The herd leaders will often help.

Esther sees a Bounsweet fighting off a few Tyrogue while she’s on patrol. The Bounsweet radiates defiant energy and challenges the odds fighting off multiple aggressors. It faints after the battle Esther brings it back to the ranch to nurse it. She learns that the rangers sometimes introduce trained pokémon to eco-systems when they want to balance pokémon populations. Tsareena is a popular choice in the Rolling Fields because it aloof and usually doesn’t involve itself with humans but will suppress the more violent pokémon like Pangoro & Manectric. As a grass-type it also won’t greatly imbalance other pokémon populations.

Pari eats Bounsweet’s dream, and Esther gets a whiff of its motives.

#poke-pov : Bounsweet
- Vexed

When Bounsweet awakens Esther tempts it with power, she offers it a chance to watch the world coronation series match with her in 3 days. Bounsweet lingers around, often trains—engages in fights with Pyrrha & Zigzagoon.

Pyrrha & Houndour vs Manectric pack

Houndour burns the Manectric on its side.

_**Evening**_

A dragon tamer visits the ranch; he was in town to watch the WCS match and wanted the freshest Moo Moo milk for his younger drakelings. Esther asks him about Pyrrha. He deduces Pyrrha’s heritage and suggests why she goes on rampages. Pyrrha is yet too young to fully combat her instincts, so the Dragon Tamer suggests Esther be on the lookout for something soothing, a soothe bell or a poké-flute. Additionally, until they’ve got a hold on her rage, she should work to keep Pyrrha from evolving with an Everstone since more power with the same lack of control could lead to dire consequences.

Jangmo-o are very disciplined dragons, so the Tamer suggests Esther bleed off Pyrrha’s aggression and fortify her discipline through battles and training. Stress Everstone once more. He offers to get them started on Scale Shot.

Esther resolves herself to double down on Pyrrha and tries the training to help Pyrrha to control herself.

Training: Focus on controlling draconic energy, through familiarity with Dragon Breath & Dragon Tail. Aim to combine the two aspects of the moves: gather energy onto the body like ‘Dragon Tail’ but project it like ‘Dragon breath.’ Use the practice ball & toy as targets.

The fencing around the Wooloo enclosure is severely damaged. Pyrrha gets the hang of Scale Shot.

A curious Wooloo sneaks out at night.

## 2022-06-24
On Shepard-duty, the missing Wooloo is discovered. Search parties are sent out. Esther sets out with the herd leader Gogoat. They notice signs of something off: smashed trees, ice shards, turfs of Wool. They investigate and find the injured Wooloo cornered by a Mamoswine. Gogoat, can’t outrun the Mamoswine while carrying Wooloo & Esther and they don’t want to ‘lead’ Mamoswine back to the ranch.

Zigzagoon is present, it wanted to help.
