Sycamore Lab: Once there a lab assistant runs a few tests (diet, relation with other pokémon {Electrike}) and discovers the mysterious power pervading Halay’s body. Characteristic of pokémon native to route 10.

Esther plots her journey north and along the coast. Lunch.

### Afternoon

The red clay badlands with strong winds that can whip up dust storms. Esther hears Flygon sing within a sandstorm, attempts to find a Trapinch but fails. Gleefully uses her aviator googles.
