## Old 

Catching up – siblings banter, little sister wants gifts, What's the progress of excavation? (Establish exacation progress; they've got clues on the location of one of the temples, they want to start clearing jungle and excavating.) Esther wants to use the Steelhead armor on her Pokemon; travel to Cocona village  
  
There's an Exploration & Excavation Club formed from handful of members; they've also taken to using the Steelhead Armor to try and bond with Pokémon since they can't forest through the jungle without protection. Supurna is the resident expert on empathy bonding with Pokemon.

Latest discoveries — empathy linked to aura; Testing out the Steelhead Armor, Battle on Cocona Island, Test whether empathy-sync with her Pokémon is a viable strategy; how does it work in battle?  
  
While synced, Esther can tap into the 'instinct' of her Pokémon.  
  
Extensive active use of Empathy drains aura and leaves user exhausted.  
  
Minor mishaps; reprimand for using the armor; intro to factionalism

Return to Sophia; Team discussion, cue in about Salamence and Esther's goals; bond/'attune' with Halay – this takes a lot longer than Pyrrha, in fact it takes several hours for small progress yet still isn't at the same level as Pyrrha  
  
Esther postulates reasons – Dark Aura interfering? (She recalls Halay had been able to repel her empathy in Galar) Halay's aura also feels a lot bigger than Pyrrha, suggesting she's stronger/older, maybe younger pokemon are easier to bond?  
  
Given they're aligning Aura's the word attuned is more accurate — attuned wavelengths

Esther tends to the Wurmple and lets her pokemon play about the farm; Kasriel gets into the honey and pisses off the Combee; Esther wonders whether it would be a good idea to expand the farm's repertoire of (bug) Pokémon  

#seed-planted 
Esther wants to catch other Bug-Types to send back to her parents:



Parisa sulks about no gifts; Esther suggests getting her a pokemon, so she can have a head start on her training – the discussion about what pokemon would be good for her also has Esther thinking about what pokemon could fit onto her team, Esther promises to keep Parisa in the loop about what pokemon she encounters

Esther's up early to tend to the Combee and helps Kasriel makes amends, he leaves with honey to share with the rest of her pokemon  
  
  
Evening  
  
Back to research pokemon for flight, learns about flight license, needs a large pokemon and to buy necessary flight gear for safety; there were a few types: flight baskets (similar to Galar taxies), saddles (Akylas wears one of these), or Flight suites (Kalosian)  
  
Large baskets tend to require large and powerful fliers, Braviary, Corviknight, Staraptor, even Swellow if they were strong enough; Saddled tended to require less of the Pokemon in raw strength but did have size requirements—for all it's power you couldn't exactly saddle a 2 ft Swellow  
  
Flight suites didn't require as much from the pokemon's physicality, it just require the ability to generate strong gusts—Tailwind was preferred, but Gust and Hurricane were substitutes, albeit requires a lot more from the pokemon  
  
Masquerain stands out as Susu evolves, but she'd need to buy the TR to teach it to her  
  
Butterfree, Pelipper, Honchkrow, Whimsicott, Rufflet, Xatu and Vullaby are amongst the earliest to learn this move. Oblivia had Xatu, right?  
  
Further reading, Drifloon can pass down this move. Perfect — there are Drifloon on Sophia Islands, in the Canal Ruins! She'd heard about the rangers using Drifloon and Drifblim to navigate the ruins.

# 2022-07-29
Set off to Canal ruins, brings all her Pokemon, her climbing kit and heads to the beach to collect her windsail board; curious passersby on the beach, Supurna  
  
Sophian Road – Raichu, they evolve with Thunderstone right? Was there a deposit somewhere around here?  
  
Espies a Pineco eating a Yanma, Pokédex entry to Pineco – preys on insect pokemon, uses a saliva that hardens on contact with air, tendency to explode — Esther gives it a wide berth  
  
Traverse the Sophia river via windsail board and reached Canal Ruins
