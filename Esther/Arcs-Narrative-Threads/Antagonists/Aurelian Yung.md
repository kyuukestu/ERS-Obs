Aurelian $\to$  _“Golden, gilded”_ (Latin _aureus_).
![No-Name Yung](https://pm1.aminoapps.com/6364/58edf1e0e2c64522848a0f4057385597636ef08a_00.jpg)

Illegitimate Child of [Dr. Yung](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dr._Yung) -  Brilliant Scientist

### Backstory
His mother was a Lab Assistant who worked on the Mirage System; when Dr. Yung died, she was newly pregnant. Aurelian was raised in the Shadow of his father with a mother who constantly drew comparisons both positive and negative.

Buys into his own genius yet understands even a man as brilliant as his father could be brought down by the petty schemes and envy of others (Professor Oak, Pokemon League); the League offers a Faustian Bargain, offering accolades and recognition in exchange for conformity and control.

*The [Mirage System](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mirage_Pok%C3%A9mon) was seen as cruel and disrespectful to Pokemon; a stance Aurelian sees as hypocritical as the alternative is to continue to force Pokemon to battle in needless blood-sport.*

**Perspective Filter**: “I want the world to see my light… but only if it burns by my own hand; I will not be snuffed as my father was”
- Self-Aggrandizing, Somewhat of a Braggart
- Wary of Authority, *"Always eager to destroy that which it cannot control."*
- Secretive & Cautious

His Mother passed on data from his father. He knows about Mirage Mewtwo and rationalized that if even the 'Perfect' specimen failed, then he must either amass overwhelming power or subtly grow his influence.

Avenues of Investigations:
- Power 
	- Mega Evolution $\to$ Solidifies Mirages
	- Z-Moves $\to$ Single Use, unsustainable
	- Dynamax $\to$ Explored but deemed too localized to Galar
	- Terastalization $\to$  Shadow Pokemon 
- Influence
	- Zoroark's Illusion - Potentially more substantial, rumors of a Zoroark who could create legendary Pokemon and who's illusions could cause physical damage. Although this is ultimately revealed as fake, Aurelian is able to hack/sniff the events and learns about the Time Ripple. The Time Ripple would allow him to 'reset' time and create invincible Mirages which re-wind all their damage.
