Illegitimate Child of [Dr. Yung](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dr._Yung) -  Brilliant Scientist

### Backstory
His mother was a Lab Assistant who worked on the Mirage System; when Dr. Yung died, she was newly pregnant. Aurelian was raised in the Shadow of his father with a mother who constantly drew comparisons both positive and negative.

Buys into his own genius yet understands even a man as brilliant as his father could be brought down by the petty schemes and envy of others (Professor Oak, Pokemon League); the League offers a Faustian Bargain, offering accolades and recognition in exchange for conformity and control.

**Perspective Filter**: “I want the world to see my light… but only if it burns by my own hand; I will not be snuffed as my father was”
- Self-Aggrandizing, Somewhat of a Braggart
- Wary of Authority, *"Always eager to destroy that which it cannot control."*
- Secretive & Cautious
